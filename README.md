# Landmarks

This is a side project I developed because I love maps. Also, I happened to learn working with the Google Maps JS API while developing it so there was that as well.

## What is Landmarks?

A world map of cool landmarks and respective information. It's an interactive way to learn about interesting geography, weird archeological facts, various points of interest, and any other intriguing geospatial data.

## Can I Add Landmarks?

It'd be cool to have people add in their own markers on the map for cool places around the world. But obviously this can easily be abused so for now, user input is not being implemented.
